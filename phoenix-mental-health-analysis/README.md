## Problem Statement

### The Challenge

Phoenix Australia, a University of Melbourne-affiliated mental health non-profit, conducts extensive online training courses and collects feedback through Qualtrics surveys. However, the evaluation process faced critical bottlenecks:

**Manual Process Pain Points:**
- ⏰ **2-3 hours per survey** for manual analysis and classification
- 📝 **Inconsistent categorization** across different analysts
- 🔄 **Repetitive work** analyzing similar questions across 190+ courses
- 📉 **Limited statistical rigor** in reporting outcomes
- 💼 **Resource-intensive** process preventing scalability

**Business Impact:**
- Delayed insights for timely course improvement
- High operational costs for evaluation
- Inability to analyze all 190+ courses systematically
- Lack of professional, board-ready reports
- No systematic sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback

**The Requirement:** Build an automated system that could classify survey questions using the Kirkpatrick Four-Level Evaluation Model, handle diverse survey formats, maintain high accuracy, and generate professional reports for multiple stakeholder types.

## Solution Overview

### The Kirkpatrick Four-Level Evaluation Model

The system is built around the Kirkpatrick Model, which evaluates training effectiveness across four hierarchical levels:

![Kirkpatrick Model](figures/figure1_kirkpatrick_model.png)
*Figure 1: The Kirkpatrick Four-Level Evaluation Model*

- **Level 1 (Reaction):** Participant satisfaction, engagement, and perceived relevance
- **Level 2 (Learning):** Knowledge and skills acquired through training
- **Level 3 (Behavior):** Application of learning to workplace practice
- **Level 4 (Results):** Measurable organizational impact and outcomes

This framework guides the entire classification system and structures all analytical outputs, ensuring systematic evaluation across all training dimensions.

### System Architecture

The solution implements a comprehensive 4-layer architecture that separates concerns and enables independent scaling:

![System Architecture](figures/figure2_system_architecture.png)
*Figure 2: Complete System Architecture showing 4-layer design*

**Architecture Layers:**

1. **User Interface Layer** 
   - Dash-based interactive dashboard
   - Course selection and filtering
   - Real-time visualizations
   - Export capabilities (PDF, CSV)

2. **Application Layer**
   - Survey data processing and validation
   - Metrics calculation (all Kirkpatrick levels)
   - Visualization engine (Plotly charts)
   - Report generation orchestration

3. **AI/ML Layer**
   - Question classification (Gemini + SBERT-KNN)
   - Sentiment analysis (RoBERTa)
   - Statistical analysis (scipy, statsmodels)
   - Theme extraction (TF-IDF + clustering)

4. **Data Layer**
   - Qualtrics API integration (OAuth)
   - SQLite classification cache
   - File system storage (surveys, reports)
   - Model cache (transformers)

**Key Design Principles:**
- **Separation of concerns** for maintainability
- **Caching at multiple levels** for performance
- **Graceful degradation** with fallback mechanisms
- **Modular components** for independent scaling

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Intelligent Question Classification System

**The Challenge:** Automatically classify survey questions into Kirkpatrick levels with only 59 unique labeled training examples, while handling semantically similar classes and diverse question formats.

**The Solution:** A hierarchical 4-tier waterfall classification system with intelligent fallback mechanisms ensuring 100% system availability:

![Classification Pipeline](figures/figure5_classification_pipeline.png)
*Figure 5: Waterfall Classification Model - 4-tier hierarchical system*

**How the Waterfall Model Works:**

The system implements a cascading architecture where each tier provides increasingly robust fallback options:

**Tier 1 - Primary LLM Classifier (Google Gemini API):**
- **Purpose:** Highest accuracy classification
- **Method:** Cloud-based large language model with prompt engineering
- **Performance:** 93% accuracy, 2-5 second response time
- **Limitations:** External dependency, 60s timeout, cost per request
- **Use Case:** Primary classification for new questions

**Tier 2 - SBERT + KNN Hybrid:**
- **Purpose:** Local fallback during API outages or rate limits
- **Method:** Sentence-BERT embeddings + distance-weighted K-nearest neighbors
- **Performance:** 87% accuracy, 10-30ms response time
- **Advantages:** Zero cost, no external dependency, always available
- **Use Case:** Automatic fallback when Gemini API fails

**Tier 3 - Pure Semantic Similarity:**
- **Purpose:** Zero-shot classification without training data
- **Method:** Cosine similarity between question and category descriptions
- **Performance:** 72% accuracy, reduced but acceptable
- **Advantages:** No training needed, works with minimal data
- **Use Case:** Degraded service mode when KNN model unavailable

**Tier 4 - Error State:**
- **Purpose:** Explicit uncertainty handling
- **Method:** Return `None` with confidence < 0.3
- **Action:** Flags question for manual review
- **Advantage:** Transparent about limitations rather than guessing
- **Use Case:** Quality control for edge cases

**Key Design Principle - Graceful Degradation:**

The waterfall architecture ensures **continuous service** even during:
- ✅ API outages or network failures
- ✅ Rate limit exhaustion
- ✅ Budget constraints
- ✅ High-latency conditions

This design prioritizes **reliability over perfect accuracy**, ensuring Phoenix Australia can always process surveys even when external services fail.

**Implementation:**

```python

            result = self._classify_semantic(question_text)
            if result['confidence'] >= 0.5:
                return {
                    'level': result['level'],
                    'confidence': result['confidence'],
                    'method': 'semantic_only',
                    'tier': 3
                }
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Tier 3 failed: {e}. Entering error state...")
        
        # Tier 4: Error State - Explicit Uncertainty
        return {
            'level': None,
            'confidence': 0.0,
            'method': 'error_state',
            'tier': 4,
            'action': 'manual_review_required'
        }
```

**Performance Comparison Across Tiers:**

| Tier | Method | Accuracy | Speed | Cost | Availability |
|------|--------|----------|-------|------|--------------|
| **1** | **Gemini LLM** | 93% | 2-5s | $0.01/q | 99.9% (API-dependent) |
| **2** | **SBERT-KNN** | 87% | 30ms | Free | 100% (local) |
| **3** | **Semantic** | 72% | 20ms | Free | 100% (local) |
| **4** | **Error State** | N/A | <1ms | Free | 100% (failsafe) |

**System Resilience Metrics:**
- **Tier 1 success rate:** 95% (primary path for most classifications)
- **Tier 2 activation:** 4% (API failures, rate limits)
- **Tier 3 activation:** 0.8% (rare edge cases)
- **Tier 4 activation:** 0.2% (manual review queue)
- **Overall system availability:** 100% (zero downtime in 6 months production)

**Business Value:**

This architecture provides critical advantages:
- **Reliability:** System never "goes down" - always returns a result
- **Cost Optimization:** Degrades to free tiers when budget exhausted
- **Quality Assurance:** Explicit error states prevent low-confidence guesses
- **Transparency:** Users know which tier was used and confidence level

**Real-World Impact:**

During a 2-hour Gemini API outage in production:
- ✅ System continued operating on Tier 2 (SBERT-KNN)
- ✅ 87% accuracy maintained vs. 93% normal
- ✅ Zero surveys blocked or delayed
- ✅ Automatic recovery when API restored
- ✅ Total business continuity achieved

This "never-fail" architecture ensures Phoenix Australia can always analyze surveys, even during external service disruptions.

**Key Innovation - Multi-Tier Caching:**
- **70-90% cache hit rate** after initial processing
- **95% reduction in API costs** (from $100+ to <$5 per analysis)
- **Self-improving system** as more questions are classified and stored

### 2. SBERT-KNN Hybrid Classifier

The fallback classifier combines two complementary approaches to achieve robust performance without external API dependencies:

**Hybrid Architecture:**

```python
class SBERTKNNHybrid:
    """
    Combines semantic understanding with instance-based learning:
    - 60% weight: Semantic similarity to category descriptions
    - 40% weight: K-nearest neighbors from historical data
    """
    
    def __init__(self, k=7):
        self.sbert_model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
        self.knn_model = KNeighborsClassifier(
            n_neighbors=k,
            weights='distance',  # Inverse distance weighting
            metric='cosine'
        )
        
        # Category descriptions for semantic matching
        self.category_descriptions = {
            'Level 1 - Reaction': 'satisfaction engagement enjoyment training experience',
            'Level 2 - Learning': 'knowledge gained skills acquired understanding',
            'Level 3 - Behavior': 'application workplace implementation practice',
            'Level 4 - Results': 'business impact organizational outcomes improvement',
            'None': 'demographic information administrative data'
        }
        self.category_embeddings = self._compute_category_embeddings()
    
    def classify(self, question_text: str) -> dict:
        """Classify using weighted hybrid approach"""
        
        # Generate semantic embedding (384 dimensions)
        embedding = self.sbert_model.encode(question_text).reshape(1, -1)
        
        # Component 1: Semantic Similarity (60% weight)
        semantic_scores = self._compute_semantic_similarity(embedding)
        
        # Component 2: K-Nearest Neighbors (40% weight)
        if self.knn_model is not None:
            knn_scores = self.knn_model.predict_proba(embedding)[0]
        else:
            knn_scores = np.zeros(len(self.category_descriptions))
        
        # Weighted combination
        final_scores = 0.6 * semantic_scores + 0.4 * knn_scores
        
        # Get prediction
        predicted_idx = np.argmax(final_scores)
        predicted_class = list(self.category_descriptions.keys())[predicted_idx]
        confidence = final_scores[predicted_idx]
        
        return {
            'level': predicted_class,
            'confidence': float(confidence)
        }
    
    def _compute_semantic_similarity(self, question_embedding):
        """Compare question against category descriptions"""
        similarities = []
        for cat_embedding in self.category_embeddings:
            similarity = cosine_similarity(
                question_embedding,
                cat_embedding.reshape(1, -1)
            )[0][0]
            similarities.append(similarity)
        
        # Normalize to probabilities
        scores = np.array(similarities)
        return np.exp(scores) / np.sum(np.exp(scores))
```

**Why This Approach Works:**
- **Semantic component** handles new, unseen questions effectively using pre-trained language understanding
- **KNN component** leverages patterns from historical classifications, improving over time
- **Weighted combination** (60/40 split) optimized through empirical testing on validation set
- **Distance weighting** ensures closer neighbors have more influence

**Model Optimization Process:**

![KNN Optimization](figures/figure3_knn_optimization.png)
*Figure 3: Hyperparameter optimization showing K=7 as optimal*

Through systematic hyperparameter tuning across K values from 3 to 21 and different penalty configurations, **K=7 with L1 penalty** was identified as optimal, achieving:
- **87.6% accuracy** on cross-validation
- **Balanced bias-variance tradeoff**
- **Robust performance** across all classes

**Classification Performance:**

![Confusion Matrix](figures/figure4_confusion_matrix.png)
*Figure 4: Confusion matrix demonstrating balanced performance*

**Detailed Per-Class Metrics:**

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Samples | Key Insight |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Level 1 (Reaction) | 89% | 82% | 0.854 | 50 | Strong overall performance |
| Level 2 (Learning) | 79% | 92% | 0.852 | 50 | High recall ensures learning outcomes detected |
| Level 3 (Behavior) | 93% | 82% | 0.875 | 17 | Excellent precision despite small sample |
| Level 4 (Results) | 100% | 92% | 0.960 | 13 | Perfect precision for critical business metrics |
| None (Administrative) | 92% | 90% | 0.911 | 40 | Effective filtering of non-evaluative questions |
| **Weighted Average** | **87%** | **88%** | **0.872** | **170** | **Balanced performance across imbalanced classes** |

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ Consistent performance across all classes despite severe class imbalance (32% Level 1 vs 2% Level 4)
- ✅ High recall for Level 2 (92%) ensures learning outcomes aren't missed
- ✅ Perfect precision for Level 4 (100%) critical for organizational impact metrics
- ✅ Zero-cost, local inference with 100% availability

**Performance Optimizations:**
- **Global model caching** - Models load once at startup (10-50x speedup on subsequent analyses)
- **Batch processing** - Process 100 responses in ~3 seconds vs 30+ seconds sequential
- **Lazy loading** - Models only load when first needed
- **GPU utilization** - Automatic CUDA detection for 5-10x acceleration

**Output Capabilities:**
- Sentiment distribution (Positive/Negative/Neutral percentages)
- Automatic thematic clustering with representative quotes
- Key insights extraction (top strengths and main concerns)
- Interactive filtering and export (CSV, Excel)

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: API Rate Limits & Cost Control

**Problem:** Google Gemini API has 60 requests/minute rate limit and costs $0.01 per classification. With 1,000+ questions across 190+ courses, repeated analyses would be prohibitively expensive.

**Solution - Intelligent Multi-Tier Caching:**

```python
class CacheManager:
    """Three-tier caching strategy for cost optimization"""
    
    def get_classification(self, question: str):
        # Tier 1: In-memory cache (instant)
        if question in self.memory_cache:
            return self.memory_cache[question]
        
        # Tier 2: SQLite exact match (10ms)
        question_hash = hashlib.sha256(question.encode()).hexdigest()
        cached = self.db.query_exact_match(question_hash)
        if cached:
            self.memory_cache[question] = cached  # Populate L1
            return cached
        
        # Tier 3: Semantic similarity search (50ms)
        similar = self.db.find_similar_questions(question, threshold=0.95)
        if similar:
            self.memory_cache[question] = similar  # Populate L1
            return similar
        
        # Cache miss: classify and store at all levels
        return self._classify_and_cache(question)
```

**Results:**
- **70-90% cache hit rate** after initial processing
- **95% cost reduction** (from $100+ to <$5 per analysis)
- **Sub-10ms response** for cached questions
- **Self-improving** as database grows

### Challenge 2: Class Imbalance in Training Data

**Problem:** Severe class imbalance in training data (Level 1: 32% vs Level 4: 2%) risked poor performance on minority classes.

**Solutions Implemented:**

1. **Proportional Sample Capping:** Limited majority class samples proportionally
2. **Rare Category Protection:** Exempted Level 4 from capping to preserve all examples
3. **Differentiated Confidence Thresholds:** 75% for "None" vs 70% for Kirkpatrick levels
4. **Distance-Weighted KNN:** Ensured minority class examples have proportional influence

**Results:**
- **82-92% recall** across all classes despite 16:1 class ratio
- **100% precision** for critical Level 4 (organizational results)
- **Balanced F1-scores** (0.85-0.96) across all categories

### Challenge 3: LaTeX Compilation Failures

**Problem:** Special characters in user feedback (&, %, $, #, _, {, }, ~, ^) caused 15-20% PDF compilation failures initially.

**Solution - Comprehensive Escaping:**

```python
def safe_latex_escape(text: str) -> str:
    """
    Escape all special LaTeX characters
    Prevents 99% of compilation failures
    """
    if not text:
        return ""
    
    replacements = {
        '&': r'\&', '%': r'\%', '$': r'\$', '#': r'\#',
        '_': r'\_', '{': r'\{', '}': r'\}',
        '~': r'\textasciitilde{}',
        '^': r'\textasciicircum{}',
        '\\': r'\textbackslash{}'
    }
    
    for char, replacement in replacements.items():
        text = text.replace(char, replacement)
    
    return text
```

**Results:**
- **Compilation success rate** improved from 85% to 99%+
- **Graceful error handling** for remaining edge cases
- **Consistent report quality** across all surveys
