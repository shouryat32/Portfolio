### ❤️ Cardiac Arrhythmia Prediction System
**Published Research | Undergraduate Thesis | 2019 - 2020**


**Description:**
Machine learning-based diagnostic system to predict cardiac arrhythmias from electrocardiogram (ECG) data. Published research project that classifies patients into 13 different cardiac conditions, enabling early detection of potentially life-threatening heart rhythm abnormalities.

**Tech Stack:** `Python` `scikit-learn` `NumPy` `Pandas` `Matplotlib` `UCI Dataset`

**The Problem:**
Cardiac arrhythmias are irregular heartbeats that can lead to serious complications including stroke, heart failure, and sudden cardiac arrest. Traditional diagnosis requires expert cardiologists to manually analyze ECG readings—a time-consuming process prone to human error.

**Technical Approach:**
- **Data Processing:** Handled 452 patients × 279 ECG features with missing value imputation
- **Feature Engineering:** Implemented two dimensionality reduction approaches:
  - PCA: Reduced 278 features → 50 principal components
  - Random Forest: Selected ~70 most important features
- **Multi-class Classification:** Compared 8 model variants across 4 algorithms:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (k=13, uniform & weighted voting)
  - Support Vector Machine (linear kernel)
  - Logistic Regression with gradient descent
  - Gaussian Naive Bayes
- **Visualization:** Applied t-SNE for high-dimensional data visualization

**Classification Targets (13 Conditions):**
Normal, Ischemic Changes, Anterior MI, Inferior MI, Sinus Tachycardia, Sinus Bradycardia, Ventricular PVC, Supraventricular PVC, Left Bundle Branch Block, Right Bundle Branch Block, Left Ventricular Hypertrophy, Atrial Fibrillation, Others

**Model Performance:**
- Achieved **72%+ accuracy** on UCI Cardiac Arrhythmia dataset
- Systematic comparison of 8 different model configurations
- End-to-end ML pipeline from raw data to predictions

**Research Impact:**
- 📝 **Published in Springer ERCICA Volume 1** (2020)
- 🎤 Presented at International Conference on Emerging Research in Computing, Information, Communication and Applications
- 🏥 Contributes to AI-assisted medical diagnostics for scalable healthcare
- 🔬 Provides comparative baseline for future cardiac ML research

**Key Learnings:**
- Handling real-world medical datasets with missing values and class imbalance
- Implementing and comparing multiple ML algorithms systematically
- Feature selection techniques for high-dimensional medical data
- Academic research workflow from experimentation to publication
