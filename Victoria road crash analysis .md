## Objectives

The primary objectives of this analysis were to:

- Identify temporal patterns in road crashes across Victoria
- Analyze the relationship between crash severity and various contributing factors
- Visualize geographical distribution of accidents
- Explore demographic patterns in road crash involvement
- Provide actionable insights for road safety improvements

## Data Source

**Dataset:** Victoria Road Crash Data  
**Provider:** Department of Transport and Planning, Victorian Government  
**Source Link:** [Data.Vic - Victoria Road Crash Data](https://discover.data.vic.gov.au/dataset/victoria-road-crash-data)

The dataset is a comprehensive collection of fatal and injury road crash data validated from Victoria Police reports and hospital injury information. The data includes multiple tables covering accident details, person demographics, vehicle information, road conditions, atmospheric conditions, and location data.

### Data Structure

The dataset comprises several interconnected tables:
- **Accident:** Basic accident details, time, severity, and location
- **Person:** Demographics including age and gender
- **Vehicle:** Vehicle type and make information
- **Accident Event:** Sequence of events (e.g., left road, rollover)
- **Road Surface Condition:** Wet, dry, icy conditions
- **Atmospheric Condition:** Weather factors like rain and wind
- **Node:** Geographical coordinates for mapping

**Update Frequency:** Monthly (with a 7-month lag for data validation)  
**License:** Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International

## Tools & Technologies

- **Tableau Public** - Data visualization and dashboard creation
- **Data Processing** - CSV file handling and data preparation
- **Geographic Visualization** - Location-based crash mapping

## Key Visualizations

The dashboard includes several interactive visualizations:

1. **Temporal Analysis** - Time-series trends showing crash patterns over different periods
2. **Geographic Distribution** - Spatial mapping of crash locations across Victoria
3. **Severity Analysis** - Breakdown of crashes by injury severity
4. **Demographic Insights** - Analysis of crash involvement by age groups and other demographics
5. **Contributing Factors** - Visualization of road conditions, weather, and other environmental factors

## Key Insights

Through this analysis, several important patterns emerged regarding road safety in Victoria:

- Identification of high-risk time periods and locations
- Correlation between environmental conditions and crash severity
- Demographic groups with higher crash involvement rates
- Patterns in accident types and contributing factors

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Analysis:** Working with large, multi-table government datasets
- **Data Visualization:** Creating clear, interactive dashboards
- **Geographic Analysis:** Spatial data visualization and mapping
- **Business Intelligence:** Translating data into actionable insights
- **Tool Proficiency:** Advanced Tableau techniques and best practices

## Project Context

This project was completed as part of my coursework, demonstrating my ability to work with real-world government data, perform comprehensive analysis, and communicate findings through effective visualizations.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements and extensions to this analysis could include:

- Predictive modeling to identify high-risk scenarios
- Integration with additional datasets (traffic volume, road infrastructure)
- Time-series forecasting for crash trends
- Advanced statistical analysis of contributing factors
- Interactive filtering for specific regions or demographics

## Data Disclaimer

The Victoria Road Crash Data is provided by the Victorian Government. Data relating to recent fatal crashes is provisional and subject to change. All analysis and visualizations are based on the data available at the time of analysis.
